The components folder should contain components that are shared across views.

Please colocate the components that belong to a particular page in its route folder within the `app` folder.

```
components/
  ├── blocks/          # Larger components (ProductCard, etc.)
  └── elements/        # Basic components (Button, Input, etc.)
```
